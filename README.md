# RNSR
R package containing tools to access the Native Status Resolver API and associated functionality

## Description
The NSR package for R (a.k.a. the RNSR) provides users with access to the Native Status Resolver (NSR) API in R.  
The Native Status Resolver takes taxonomic and political information as input and returns information on whether a given plant species is thought to be native, introduced, etc., as well as the basis for that decision. For more information on the NSR, see the main NSR page on the BIEN website (https://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/tools/nsr/). For the code underlying the NSR application, see the NSR repo (https://github.com/ojalaquellueva/nsr).

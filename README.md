# RNSR
R package containing tools to access the Native Species Resolver API and associated functionality

## Decription
The NSR package for R (a.k.a. the RNSR) provides users with access to the Native Species Resolver (NSR) API in R.  
The Native Species Resolver takes taxonomic and political information as input and returns information on whether a given plant species is thought to be native, introduced, etc., as well as the basis for that decision.
